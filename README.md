# PAM: Prompting Audio-Language Models for Audio Quality Assessment
[[`Paper`](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.00282)] [[`data`](https://github.com/soham97/PAM/tree/main?tab=readme-ov-file#data)]

PAM is a no-reference metric for assessing audio quality for different audio processing tasks. It prompts Audio-Language Models (ALMs) using an antonym prompt strategy to calculate an audio quality score. It does not require reference data or task-specific models and correlates well with human perception.

## News
[Jul 24] Improved human correlation across tasks [[commit]](https://github.com/soham97/PAM/commit/5ee2bbe586917456981f7ddc5e933a97b9e526cd)<br>
[Mar 24] PAM is accepted at INTERSPEECH 2024

## Setup
Open the [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com) terminal and run:
```shell
> git clone https://github.com/soham97/PAM.git
> cd PAM 
> conda create -n pam python=3.10
> conda activate pam
> pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Compute PAM
#### Folder evaluation 
To compute PAM on folder containing audio files, you can directly run:
```shell
> python run.py --folder {folder_path}
```
The symbol `{..}` indicates user input. 

#### Custom evaluation
To compute PAM on heirarchy of folder or multiple directory, we recommed creating a custom dataset. 
- In `dataset.py` creating a custom dataset by inheriting from `AudioDataset`, similar to `ExampleDataset`
- Modify the `get_filelist` function to fit to your directory structure
- Update the `run.py` with your custom dataset and make changes to evaluation if needed

## Data
The manuscript uses data from multiple sources. It can be obtained as follows:
- For the text-to-audio and text-to-music generation, we conducted the human listening test using Amazon Turk. The audio generated by models and human listening scores are available at: [Zenodo](https://zenodo.org/records/10737388)
- For text-to-music generation with FAD comparison (Figure 6), we used the data and human listening scores from [Adapting Frechet Audio Distance for Generative Music Evaluation
 (ICASSP 24)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.01616). The website is [here](https://github.com/microsoft/fadtk)
 - For text-to-speech generation, we used the data and human listening scores from [Evaluating speech synthesis by training recognizers on synthetic speech (2023)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.00706)
 - For distortions (Figure 4) we sourced the data from NISQA. The data with human listening scores, can be downloaded from the GitHub repo: [here](https://github.com/gabrielmittag/NISQA).
 - For voice conversion, we use the voice conversion subset from the VoiceMOS Challenge data. The data can be downloaded at: [Zenodo](https://zenodo.org/records/10691660)

## Paper reproduction
This section covers reproducing numbers for text-to-audio and text-to-music. First download the human listening test data by following the instruction listed above. The download should contain a folder titled `human_eval`.

Then run the following commands.
```shell
> python pcc.py --folder {folder_path}
```
where `{folder_path}` points to `human_eval` folder.
